# 🛡️ Fintech & Legal Rules

> **Objective**: Eliminate legal risks and ensure platform integrity.

## 1. Anti-Ponzi / Anti-Banking Law
**Core Rule**: We are a **Community Platform**, NOT a Financial Institution.

- **No Interest**: "Credit" never accumulates interest. It is a prepaid point system.
- **No Investment**: Forbidden terms: "Investment", "Dividend", "Profit".
- **Refund Policy**: Credits are refundable (minus fees), but Deposits are conditional.

## 2. "Law of Large Numbers" Prevention (Eating-and-Running)
**Risk**: Leader withdrawing all funds and disappearing.

- **P-043 (Meeting Quorum)**: Regular meetings (events) require >50% attendance to be confirmed.
- **P-044 (Attendee Voting)**: Only *Attendee* can vote on expenses related to that meeting.
- **P-015 (Challenge Account)**: Funds belong to the Challenge entity, not the Leader's personal wallet.

## 3. Deposit Lock System
**Risk**: Members failing to pay monthly support.

- **Lock**: 1 Month worth of Support + Penalty buffer is LOCKED.
- **Auto-Deduction**: If Balance < Support, system deducts from Lock.
- **Forfeiture**: If user is auto-kicked (60 days no-recharge), Lock is forfeited to Platform (Revenue), not to Leader.

## 4. Abuse Prevention
- **Leader**: Cannot transfer Leadership without 70% member vote (unless manual handover).
- **False Report**: 1 account = 1 report count. 20 reports = Auto suspension. 3x False Reports = Ban.
